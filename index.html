    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello.  I am Nathan and I'm currently enrolled in a life changing experience called Dev Bootcamp.  I'm here to learn as much as I can about being a developer so that I can get a job where I'll be able to learn even more and make money.  That's the dream.</p>
    <p>I recently quit my job at a company that made healthcare software for hospital systems.  My role was to implement the software, which meant I did a lot of traveling so I could talk to the nurses, doctors, and administrators to fine tune our suite of products for their unique needs.  I really enjoyed working with some of the smartest people in healthcare and also working with our developers to build software that will keep pace with a fast moving industry and continue to improve patient care.  My favorite part of my job was designing new features or updating existing features to better account for the workflows of our customers.  However, I didn't get to actually write the code.</p>
    <p>I decided to partake in Dev Bootcamp because I knew what developers did and I believe that I can do that excellently.  I also believe that in the very near future understanding code, even if it's not your primary job, will be very important. I've always been interested in coding and I'm really excited about taking this jump into the unknown and trying something completely different.</p>

    <p>In the very near future there will be projects down here that you can click on and see more about what I've learned and am capable of.</p>
