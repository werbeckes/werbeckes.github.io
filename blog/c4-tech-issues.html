    <h3>Keep Your Hands Off My Intellectual Property!</h3>
    <p>The concept of intellectual property is vital to a fair economy and helps protect those that spend extra money and effort to innovate.  The stealing of intellectual property by other companies and foreign countries needs to continue to be a focus.  <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4226.pdf">US International Trade Commission estimates that US businesses could add 2.1 million jobs and add tens of billions of dollars in revenue annually if the US could better support intellectual property abroad</a>.  However, here in the states, the issue of too much or too tightly regulated IP is also an issue.</p>  

    <p>Companies compete over the remnants of those that went under just for the patents so they can sue each later such as when a group of companies, including Apple, outbid Google for the 6,000 patents of Nortel Networks.  <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/02/us-dealtalk-nortel-google-idUSTRE76104L20110702">The company was bankrupt, but sold for $4.5 Billion</a>. Then there was the constant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone_patent_wars">smartphone patent wars</a> between Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, HTC, Nokia, Motorola, and others.  These are the big fights that make the news, but there are also many cases of larger companies bullying startups or soon to be competitors with IP lawsuits that they simply don’t have the money to fight.</p>

    <p>IP allows companies to protect their R&D investments, but we need to look closer at how the system works today so that we aren’t forcing companies to deal with multi-million dollar lawsuits to stay in business.  So often in patent suits the larger company wins because it has more money for a better legal team.  The way intellectual property rights work today they aren’t protecting innovation, but protecting the company with the greater revenue from the little guys that might become serious competitors later on.</p>

    <p>On the other hand there are “companies” that own patents just to sue the massive tech giants.  These patent trolls don't make any products or have any employees, but acquire old patents or file for patents with the sole purpose of making an easy few million.  They know that it is cheaper for Apple, Google, and Samsung to give them several million dollars than fight in court (and potentially lose even more).  A handful of law firms have made hundreds of millions by pushing these bogus law suits against the tech giants all through the eastern district of Texas.  The current record for a “troll” lawsuit is <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/02/company-without-a-product-wins-533m-verdict-vs-apple-says-its-no-patent-troll/">$533 million awarded to SmartFlash</a> (Apple is appealing).</p>

    <p>Although the patent trolls are successful now, their days may be numbered.  <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/02/patent-reform-hits-congress-again-with-reintroduced-innovation-act/">Congress is currently trying to bring new rules to stop this kind of frivolous litigation</a>.  However, the first time they tried it didn’t work so well (their odds are much better with a Republican controlled Senate this time).  Unfortunately, the news isn’t so good for international disputes.  You can read the ideas for next steps written by a non-partisan (but American) panel <a href="http://ipcommission.org/">here</a> about preventing products with stolen IP from entering the country and restricting those companies that the US deems to steal IP from participating in and benefiting from American stock markets and banking.  However, these measures have been slow to be implemented even though Obama is making a concerted effort to talk about IP with our neighbors in the East.</p>
