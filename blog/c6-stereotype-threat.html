    <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
    <h3>Let's not make it worse</h3>
    <p>This week we were instructed to write about Stereotype Threat.  In layman’s terms, this is the term that describes when people do worse at a task because they believe their group isn’t supposed to do well at this task.  The classic example is that black students perform worse on a standardized test if they are told beforehand that black students typically perform worse.</p>

    <p>As a white male, there aren’t a whole lot of negative performance stereotypes that I’m aware of (if there are any, don’t tell me about them).  So I couldn’t think of any examples where my white male-ness may have had a detrimental affect on my performance.  Something, potentially related, is that there were times during college when I took classes that I wasn’t “supposed” to take.  For example, I enrolled in a class that is almost exclusively taken by seniors in their last year.  I was a Freshman (with a pretty terrible counselor).  I got one of the lowest grades I’ve ever gotten that semester.  This poor performance could potentially be blamed on everyone’s belief that I wasn’t supposed to be in that class.  However, that was never my attitude.  Once I understood the odds were stacked against me I put more time and effort into the class because I wanted desperately to get better grades on each paper and test than my much more learned classmates.</p>

    <p>For anyone reading this that has experienced a real stereotype threat, I’m sorry and I hope my previous example doesn’t make you angry.  I really just don’t understand what’s it like for others to expect you to fail.  I definitely understand that the world of tech has been dominated by white and asian males.  For those that don’t fit into either of those categories I understand that this program is an even scarier leap of faith than it is for me.  What I need to do is make sure that I don’t take any actions that highlight the stereotype of a male dominated tech culture.  I just hope that being aware of stereotype threat doesn’t make me even more aware of the differences in race and gender...</p>
