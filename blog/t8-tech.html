    <h1>What is Ruby?  What is Ruby on Rails?</h1>
    <h3>Am I "on Rails" yet?</h3>
    <p>Ruby on Rails is all the rage these days and the fact that Dev Bootcamp was promoting that as their primary language was a big plus.  As we learned more and more Ruby there was always this question in the back of my mind: “Am I learning Rails right now or normal Ruby?”  When I consciously thought about I didn’t even know if I was asking the right question.  Maybe you need to learn basic Ruby and we will get to the “on Rails” portion later.  This week in our technical blog we have a lot of freedom to choice nearly any topic relating to software and so this seemed like a perfect opportunity to learn more about what I was supposed to be learning about.</p>

    <p>Ruby is a general-purpose object oriented programming language developed in the mid-90’s.  So far, we have been learning “pure Ruby.”  Ruby has some pretty great features namely it’s extensibility using the gems framework, it was(/is) easier to use than other languages popular when it was released, and it is reportedly a lot more fun to use.  In the early 00’s Ruby was growing in popularity quickly and some people that were using it decided to make it even better by creating an add-on (aka gem).  In 2004 this gem called Ruby on Rails was released and in a little over 2 years Apple committed to sending it with their next OS.  Since that time Ruby on rails (aka RoR; aka Rails) has exploded in popularity, but what is it exactly?</p>

    <p>Rails is an open-source web-development framework.  It is written in Ruby so a lot of the skills we’ve been learning will be important as we start our journey into Rails.  In addition, it has features that emphasize well-known and respected software patterns.  This means less work on the developer since the program makes assumptions (that are usually true) and I as a coder I only need to specify certain details when they differ from the norm.  This makes development faster, more interesting, and a lot more fun.</p>   

    <p>Rails also include some net new features such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Active record - an object relation mapping layer</li>
      <li>Action pack - a manager of controller and view functions</li>
      <li>Action mailer - a handler of email</li>
      <li>and many more!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Because Rails is open source and has been so popular in the last decade lots of other tools and gems are being added all the time to make the software both more powerful and more fun to use.  There is a lot of ambiguity and few examples in this post because I’ve seen precious few examples of all the features that Rails promotes.  I hope that once we get into actually coding in Rails that this high-level of understanding will aid in making me a great Rails developer quicker.</p>
