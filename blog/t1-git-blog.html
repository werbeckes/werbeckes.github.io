    <h3>Hello World!</h2>

  <section>
    <p>
      My first week of Dev Bootcamp is drawing to a close and I’m glad to say that I’ve learned a lot more about what I’ll be doing with the next 18 weeks of my life.  We’ve also been learning about the software that we will use throughout our experience here and that has focused mostly on Git and Github.
    </p>
    <p>
       I’ve heard of Github before from my techy friends, but really had no idea what it was or how powerful of a tool it will be for my future not just at DBC, but the rest of my developer career.  Github is essentially a social networking site.  You create a profile and can follow others, but rather than sharing pictures of your cat/dog/baby/this awesome place you hiked to, you share code (at least that what’s it’s used for the most, the infrastructure is there to share a lot more).  Github allows you to create a project and have others comment on it or make changes directly (based on the permissions you give them).  Even if you’re not working together, others can make their code publicly visible so that a newbie like me can read code from industry experts and examine how their brains work and what kind of elegant solutions they can dream up.  However all of this is only possible with Git.
    </p>
    <p>
       Git is the older, secluded brother of Github.  Git is mostly a background program that you only call from the terminal.  There is no sharing, pretty interface, or really any GUI at all.  What Git does provide is critical to everything that Github builds on top of.  Git is version control software, which means that it helps you store backups of each save so that you can recall specific versions later in the future if you mess something up or liked it before some changes you made.  Just like in a video game, you can save your work before you try something really risky.  If it works out, great; you can keep working from there.  If it doesn’t you can go back to the last save and try again or take a safer design strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
      How Git works is by allowing you to have a copy of the project stored on Github’s servers remotely, what we will call the origin.  Then you can clone the origin onto your personal computer so that you can make edits.  This gives you the freedom to edit whatever and however you want (and your colleagues can all edit their parts of the project at the same time).  When you accomplish your new routine or bug fix you can then push your changes back to the origin on Github for your team to evaluate and leave comments on.  If you’re working and others make updates you can also pull those edits from the origin to your cloned copy so you can test that your new code will work with their edits.  This sounds so simple, but for those of us that have tried to create a PowerPoint presentation with a team the night before a presentation it’s like feeling a shaft of sunlight from Heaven.

      Thanks for reading and I hope next week I can talk about some awesome code I’ve written!
