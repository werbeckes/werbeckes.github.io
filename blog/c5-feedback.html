    <h1>Pairing is Caring</h1>
    <h3>Feedback is fun</h3>
    <p>Pairing is an important part of Dev Bootcamp and one factor that makes it stand out compared to other such programs.  During the first few weeks I was nervous about working with other people I’d never known.  I felt like I had to spend more effort to set up a time and find someone that was working on the same problem.  My attitude quickly changed.  Working with others has a lot of benefits, even if you can solve the challenge independently.  You get a chance to network with others, get fresh ideas, a chance to learn the material you know even better by explaining to others, and a sense of camaraderie with others that are struggling and being challenged in the same ways you are.</p>

    <p>The thing I’m most surprised about during my pairing session is how much we get done so quickly.  Working with another student is very energizing and helps both of us focus on the task at hand so things that would normally distract me, don’t.  Whatever extra time and energy it takes to find a pair and organize a time and a challenge to work on is easily made up for with the amount of efficiency gained by working together.  Challenges that would normally take two plus hours are done in just over one.</p>

    <p>Although the vast majority of pairs have been awesome, there have been some that are more challenging.  I get frustrated with pairs that don’t have an understanding of basic syntax or know methods that we’ve had to use multiple times before.  When someone is just slower than me, that’s fine; I think I’m far from leading the pack and that helps me by explaining concepts that I’m still growing with.</p>

    <p>Feedback is essential for growth in any skill.  Learning something by yourself is a romantic concept that is entirely impractical.  My last employer recognized the vital importance of feedback and it was a core foundation of how we functioned.  It was rare for people to be fired.  Most understood the feedback they were getting and put effort into improving or simply decided this job wasn’t for them and left to try something else they could be better at.  I hope all future companies I work for have the same attitude.</p>

    <p>There are ways that I think their feedback process was better than that at Dev Bootcamp.  All feedback we submitted went to that person’s boss who then had a chance to review it and be an impartial party in getting details about what happened and if it was a one-time event or a trend.  So far in DBC, it seems that people write generally positive feedback, and try to pick out minor details to improve on such as “use headphones next time to prevent echoing” or “write commit messages in the imperative tense.”  Maybe it’s just that the challenges have been easy enough to not expose more significant flaws or we don’t get enough time to really know each other in an hour.  However, it feels like people are more interested in making friends with their cohort mates and not pissing anyone off than picking up things they really didn’t like or struggled with.  When we all know each other I think we might be able to better give poignant feedback, but I think at this early stage it would be better to have a third party analyze all the feedback from a unit and deliver that to the person over a video conferencing session.  This way people would feel more comfortable being honest (it may say the feedback is anonymous, but everyone knows who gives what feedback very easily) and someone with experience can verify details and help the recipient better understand what they need to do to improve in the future.</p>
