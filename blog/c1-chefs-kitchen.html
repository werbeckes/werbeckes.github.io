    <h1>Dev Bootcamp's Culture</h1>
  <h3>Why I'm excited and worried to be starting</h3>

  <section>
    <p>
      I’m really excited to be part of an organization that has the mentality of constant growth.  In my last job I had a lot of power to change processes or create new ones from scratch and that was one of the things I enjoyed the most about that culture.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the last six months I could feel myself start to slowly burn out.  I started to experience lack of motivation to do tasks that I used to enjoy and decreased satisfaction for everything in my life.  When I realized these feelings were starting I knew I needed to make changes.  I tried a few things, but came to the conclusion that I needed to try something completely different to get out of the funk and back to being the go-getter I was when I started.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m really glad that Dev Bootcamp starts off slower with only 15-25 hours/week.  It’s giving me time to take things slower and recover the energy I used to have.  I’m still concerned that I won’t have the same drive to start Phase 1 as I did to start my last job, or had all throughout college.  However, what I’m more concerned about is that I can tell I started to have a fixed mindset and a lot of cynicism for any changes at the company.  These issues seem harder to fix, but I’m really glad that the readings so far have helped me identify those weaknesses so I can begin to make improvements.
