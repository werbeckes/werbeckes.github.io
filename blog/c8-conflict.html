    <h1>Confronting Conflict</h1>
    <h3>What to do and what not to do</h3>
    <p>In my last job I worked for a large company that made software for healthcare companies.  My role was to come in after the sale had been made and work with doctors, nurses, and administrators to fine-tune the software for their unique workflows and processes.  At one of my most recent customers, Johns Hopkins, they had a blood workflow unlike anything we had ever seen.  For this post I’m going to discuss the conflicts that arose from this complicated situation, how they were resolved, and what I would do differently if I could do it all over again.<p>

    <h4>How did it start?</h4>
    <p>During my first trip to Baltimore I spend my time meeting people and asking them questions about how things work today.  The idea is I want to understand them before they start to try and understand our software.  With a large, prestigious, academic customer there is a lot to see and not enough time.  However, the meeting with the blood bank people wasn’t added to my schedule until the last minute.  I didn’t even know about it until the day of.  Also, the only time available was 30 minutes during lunch.  The room was too small and there wasn’t enough time for them to explain what they do (and my questioning usually takes twice as long as it takes them to give me an overview).</p>

    <p>When I left that meeting I didn’t fully understand the complexities of their workflow and, even worse, what I did hear I didn’t think was that hard.  Members of my team on the Hopkins side kept bringing up that many clinicians as well as themselves were nervous about it, but I was focused on other tasks. I assumed that the workflow was going to be familiar and we could tackle it in a session a few months away.  However, during our second round of demos it became apparent quickly that the blood workflow was more sophisticated than I was anticipating.  The first true conflict came when the director for the blood division accosted me in an unrelated session for answers about how her department would work.</p>

    <h4>What did I do?</h4>
    <p>I was not ready for a conversation about her workflow at that time.  I was honest about that fact, but also reassured her that we weren’t planning on being ready for another couple of months.  Again, I put off the issue, but luckily I had a great counterpart at Hopkins that put together a recurring meeting to start learning about and discussing options for this complicated screening and transfusion process.  About a month into those meetings I started to realize how massive of a project this was going to be.</p>

    <p>From then on I called on the best people I could find throughout our entire company to come and provide guidance on how to aid this customer.  If they couldn’t make the meeting I met with them whenever they had time to get their advice and possible solutions.  Most importantly, I made the blood director and her boss feel that we thought her workflow was one of our biggest issues for the install.  Another thing I emphasized was that we needed to fully understand her and her employees roles before we started talking about how we would use our software in this department.  I went to her office and gave her enough time to tell me everything she could think of and asked questions to ensure I truly did understand everything.</p>

    <p>When we started to have demos to show how our software would meet their needs I was very careful in limiting the scope of the discussion before we started.  I also learned to only include about half as much material as I normally would since the discussions were so intense and took unexpected (but necessary) tangents frequently.  I would always repeat what I knew, explain my thinking, and then show my proposed solution before giving them lots of time to discuss.</p>

    <h4>What was the resolution?</h4>
    <p>By the time I left that job to start DBC my relationship with the blood director was fantastic.  When I announced my departure one of the first things my team talked about was how they were going to tell her since they did’t think she would trust anyone as much as she trusted me at that point.  The workflow wasn’t 100% ironed out (it never is until 3 months after we turn the software on), but we had a solid base that met the majority of their needs and the structure we chose was extensible enough to handle the issues we knew about and also the things we didn’t know about, but knew would appear as we continued to unveil our solution.</p>

    <h4>What was their underlying concern?</h4>
    <p>The root of the problem was that the transfusion department knew it had very difficult workflows and they needed us to acknowledge their complexity and show them that we working hard.  This department had a team of developers working to give them custom software before and they had been excluded from past enterprise wide upgrades because no one wanted to figure out a new way to meet their complex needs.  When they only got 30 minutes of my time on Day 1 and I showed no interest in discussing further they started to get worried.  After a month of worrying and no one to talk them down that fear exploded.  They didn’t really need a solution immediately, but they needed us to feel their stress to know that we were truly interested in devising a way for them to continue to operate with the same efficiency.</p>

    <h4>What could I have done differently?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>After our initial visit I should have set up time immediately to follow-up on everything they didn’t get a chance to tell us.</li>
      <li>When I started to understand their process I should have made it more clear that I thought their department was unique and needed a unique solution and that finding that solution was a priority.  For too long I gave the impression that “there is nothing you do that I haven’t seen before” even though I was internally getting worried.  They wanted me to empathize not appear confident.</li>
      <li>Although it is vitally important to spend time learning first, I spent too long without discussing potential solutions.  They were used to the software development process and wanted to be a part of the process.  I wasn’t used to that mentality so I was trying to put together the perfect solution internally first.  At one point they called me out for not paying attention to everything they were telling me since I hadn’t done any work to fix it yet.  That was completely not true, but their impression is more important than the truth.  From that point forward I would always bring back initial ideas for solutions the meeting after each issue was brought up.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Overall, this is an extreme example of the type of thing I worked through a lot at that job so I had a lot of previous examples to draw from in how to keep clients calm and find the best solution, even if it’s not my idea.  However, there was still a lot that I hadn’t seen before and I’m glad I had the opportunity to face this conflict as it made me even better at that job and developed my conflict resolution skills, which will be useful in every job through the rest of my life.</p>
