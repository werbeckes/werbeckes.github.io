    <h1>Thinking About Thinking</h1>
    <h3>Why I am arbitrary cement</h3>
    <p>The third week of Dev Bootcamp has come and is nearly gone and I feel like it all started this morning.That’s mostly a good thing.  I’m more excited and driven to make this program change my life now than I was three weeks ago.  However, I’m worried that I haven’t learned enough.  There were all of those bonus challenges I didn’t do and so many links that I never clicked on (and some that I did, but ended up closing a week or so later because I never got to them).</p>

    <p>This blur of a phase has taught me a significant amount of technical knowledge, but probably even more about myself and what I need to do to be successful for the next 16 weeks at DBC.</p>

    <p>Before we wrote our first line of code, we took some personality tests to determine our thinking style. According to <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">this Gregorc Personal Thinking Style test</a> I am a Concrete Random.  My initial impression of that phrase was not positive.  I don’t think of myself as a very random person, but rather someone that takes the most logical path each time.  On the other hand, concrete sounds like someone that is too set in their ways and I’d like to think I’m very open to new information and constantly re-evaluate if the route I’ve chosen is still the best.</p>

    <p>Luckily, it was just the name I didn’t agree with, the description of this thinking style matched me quite well:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This learner likes to experiment to find answers — Yes! There is certainly a place for precise planning, but in my life I’ve found there are far more situations where just trying something, even if it there’s not a great chance of it working, is better than researching and theorizing.</li>
      <li>This learner likes to take risks — I’d like to think so.  I think a lot of people would describe me as more on the safer side, but that was before I quit my great job to try DBC, so their opinions might have changed.</li>
      <li>They learn best when they are able to compete with others — Yes!  Probably too much. I always compare my performance to others, usually just those I perceive as better.  I do this to an unhealthy degree. (but I am trying to get better.)</li>
      <li>They learn best when they are given the opportunity to work through the problems themselves — Definitely.  I like people, I really do, but when it comes time for technical problem solving I want to be in a quiet room alone to focus on my problem.  The pairings so far have been simple enough that there was only one minor time when I asked for a minute to think, but I am a bit worried about how to work with a partner and also have an environment where I have my brain working at 100%.  In my old job, when these types of situations arose I would work separately and come back with the person once I had a chance to digest the problem.  This is something I’m going to have to work on to be successful here at DBC.</li>
      <li>Formal reports are hard for them — Yup.  If I did the task required I would be happy to give a  superior a call or meet with them to explain my findings, but taking another couple of hours to formalize the same information in a different type of documentation? Nope.  “Just give me a call with whatever questions you have and I’d love to talk through it with you.”</li>
      <li>Re-doing anything once it is done is hard for them — Isn’t this hard for everyone?  I definitely spend more time planning before I even get started to ensure I won’t need to re-do anything in the future.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That’s all well and good, but a major goal of DBC is to help us grow and I want to take some time to think on what actions I can take to gain even more from this once in a lifetime experience.  The issue I’ve struggled with the most during this phase has been putting myself out there in the social media world.  I have done a poor job of tweeting to promote my blog and of reading others tweets and messages to learn about their struggles.</p>

    <p>Like the description above mentioned, I like working independently.  In addition, I’m coming from a job where blogging was explicitly restricted.  The idea of posting about every thought I have about an industry I’ve just jumped into doesn’t seem necessary.  There is already enough information about there about these topics, why should I add my very shallow understanding? I could go on and on (and I have to some of those closest to me when I first realized a blog and tweeting was mandatory).  However, I want to give this whole social media thing a serious effort.  I believe that building a personal brand is important and I don’t want to be the type of developer that just sits in their cube and works for the same company for the rest of their life.  I have the motivation and now it is up to me to just break through all these mental barriers to broaden my horizons and future opportunities.</p>
