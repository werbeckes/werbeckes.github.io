    <h1>What's the question?</h1>
    <h3>What's the answer?</h3>
    <p>Asking questions is an important skill any time you are not omniscient.  So, all the time.  Frankly, I don’t know how you could be successful at any job where you work with others without being able to ask intelligent questions.  This week, I’m going to go through the process I take when asking others questions.  These tips are what worked well for me in my last job of communicating with both customers and internal experts, but may not be the same steps for everyone in every field.  However, I believe that some of these steps will be useful in every situation.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>At some point in time you will realize that you are struggling and may need help from someone else to solve an issue.  For me this is usually after searching and playing around for at least 5-10 minutes.  Sometimes I’ve spent hours already, but rarely would I start this process if I haven’t done any problem solving on my own.</li>
      <li>Well before I’m ready to hit “send” on an email, I start typing up my thoughts and what I know already.  I like to start by trying to frame the question that I think I need to know.  Then I type up the background of why this issue is something I care about (and why they should care too).  Then I go through and list what I’ve already done: searched this database, searched the internal wikis using these keywords, tried xyz, but it didn’t work, etc.</li>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Succinct Question, Background, Research</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <li>As I’m going through the research I’ve already done I almost always think of additional things that I could do to prove that I couldn’t solve this issue on my own.  This list of what to check is based strongly on my experience with a topic.  The more I know, the more methods I can think of to try and solve this on my own.  Sometimes I know so little about a subject that I get to the research step and have no idea how to get an answer.  In that case I usually alter my question to ask “how do I fish?” rather than the specific question I really care about.  If at all possible, this is best done in person.  If that’s not possible, video-conferencing or a phone call is also acceptable, but “how do I fish?” emails take a lot of time to respond to and, therefore, are more likely to be deferred.</li>
      <li>At this point you’ve got an email with a question, background, and your research and many people just hit send.  But you’re better than that.  Go through and re-read the entire email and ask yourself a few questions:
      <ul>
        <li>Exactly what does the answering person need to know/do to give you the answer you need? - Is there anything else you can do to gather this information yourself?</li>
        <li>What additional info would the answering person need to give you the most complete answer? - Make their job easier and do as much grunt work as possible to show that you value their time.  Include links, attachments, code snippets, etc. that may be relevant.</li>
        <li>How can I ask this question as simply as possible? - At this point I consider the draft email to mostly be for me and to help gather my thoughts.  If you follow these tips you will start a lot of emails and end up answering the question before you hit send.  Now it’s time to trim up everything to make your email as short as possible, while including everything they need to help you.  Especially focus on the initial question you asked: did you make any progress or do you know more about what a potential solution would look like?  In 90% of cases you should be able to ask the question in one sentence.  If you get an expert they should be able to answer the question without reading the background and research you’ve done.  However, the question should act like a hook to draw them in so they want to know more about the overall situation and your goal.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>One last time before you hit send:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Think about the priority of the question: Should this be a high priority email? Should I go talk to someone immediately?</li>
        <li>Do I have the correct recipients listed?  Will they have the knowledge needed to give me a complete answer? Is there anyone else that cares about the answer that should be cced as well?</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Ok, you can hit send now</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These steps will help you get the best answers possible because the people you’re asking should be able to quickly see that you respect their time and have done everything in your power to find a solution first.  You’ll find that the more work you put into asking an intelligent question the more work your recipients will put in to giving you the most complete answer they can.</p>
