    <h1>My Values</h1>
    <h3>and what I want them to be</h3>
    <p>What values do you live your life by?  That was the question we had to ask ourselves this week.  From a huge list of attributes I selected the ones below that were associated with the happiest, proudest, and most satisfied moments in my life.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>accomplishment</li>
      <li>ambition</li>
      <li>coolness under fire</li>
      <li>creativity</li>
      <li>excitement</li>
      <li>autonomy</li>
      <li>commitment</li>
      <li>cooperation</li>
      <li>efficiency</li>
      <li>growth</li>
      <li>challenge</li>
      <li>excellence</li>
      <li>leadership</li>
      <li>responsibility</li> 
    </ul>

    <p>Trimming down even further we were asked to identify the attributes that we try to live up to constantly.  This was harder for me as I realized that the attributes I was actually prioritizing were not the same ones that I think I should be prioritizing.  To describe my current mindset with the given attributes I would say the qualities I most strive for in life are: commitment to work goals, gaining responsibility, being able to work autonomously, being efficient, and accomplishing as much as I can every day.</p>

    <p>What really bugged me about this was passing up so many attributes on the list that I think I should be thinking about and striving for.  At the beginning of this year I was incredibly miserable.  Work was going really well, I had a stellar list of clients and they all thought the world of me.  My boss wanted to keep pushing me to grow more and faster in the company as well.  However, I just couldn’t get over how much I didn’t like my life.  Since then, I’ve been doing a lot of reading and thinking about what makes me happy.</p>

    <p>What was most disappointing was reading through the list of attributes and finding ones that I know to be associated with overall happiness, but realizing I don’t truly prioritize that attribute and it wasn’t something that characterized the best moments in my life. The attributes I want to be striving for are close relationships, setting and committing to goals outside of work, staying healthy, and doing things that make me happy.  For the vast majority of my life I’ve been too focused on achievement at work or school.  I’ve never had great work/life balance and I understand that’s necessary to succeed overall in life.</p>

    <p>The question I need to ask myself now is: "what values do I want to live my life by?”  I think I understand that now.  The next step is figuring out how to make my happiness a priority while maintaining competency at everything else I do.</p>
